        <img src="./images/download.athirapilly.jpg" alt="">
        <p> On the outskirts of the city at a distance of some 60 km, the Athirappilly waterfalls mark one of the best places to visit in Thrissur. Standing 80 ft tall and about 330 ft wide, these falls are the largest in the state of Kerala.

            The majesty of this place can be understood by the fact that the falls are located on the Chalakudy River, that originates from the highest mountain in India outside of the Himalayas. A perfect place for a group outing, these falls are sometimes called the Niagra of India

        <img src="./images/download.palace.jpg" alt="">
        <p> Built after a rather Dutch style architecture, the Shakthan Thampuran Palace is a sight to behold. Finding its name in almost every list of Thrissur tourist places, the Shakthan Thampuran Palace was rebuilt in the place of Vadakkekara Palace in the year 1795 by the then King Ramavarma Thampuram of Cochin.

            In the year 2005, the palace was converted into a museum that now showcases a number of relics and really old antiques. A favourite one amongst several art admirers, the two-storeyed complex has high roofs, thicker than usual walls, and Italian Marble on the floor, making it a place right out of a travellerâ€™s dream.

        <h2 style="color: gold;">Temple</h2>
        <img src="./images/downloadtsr.jpg" alt="">
        <p>An ancient temple of Kerala, the Vadakkunnathan Temple is also the oldest temple of the state dedicated to Lord Shiva. Following the architectural style of Kerala, the temple has monumental towers surrounding it.

            Talking about the inside of the temple, there are several mural paintings that depict various episodes from the Hindu Epic, Mahabharata.
            
            Thekkinkadu Maidan, which surrounds the temple from all sides is where the local festival of Thrissur Pooram is organized every year, granting this place an even more of spiritual importance.
